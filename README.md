# Euromillions
Jogo do Euromilhoes em Python



Both codes are open-source. Feel free to use them as you wish, I only ask that you don't remove the credits of the code, if you don't the code yours by changing it.



Started a new project to introduce the Euromilhoes game to a web app using the Django and virtualenv.

This is a personal project, so I don't really know when I will actually finish it.
